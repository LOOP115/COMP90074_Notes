### Benefits of Subdomain Takeovers

* Pretty much a stored XSS bug
* Domain verification for services
* SSL certificates can be deployed
* Very convincing phishing pages
* Bypass CSP protections
* Gain access to some cookies
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) bypass
* Clickjacking bypass
* Password manager autofills (works with LastPass)
* Capturing unintended traffic
